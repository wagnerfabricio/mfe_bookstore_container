                Having been raised in the public eye at an early age, M.Y.
                Storie receded into the shadows as an adult – finding anonymity
                to be freeing and adventurous. To that end, the writer’s
                identity has remained as mysterious as the mysteries penned
                under the pseudonym “M.S. Storie.” In an online interview,
                Storie once said, “As a writer, I love that I can be anyone, at
                any place or time in history. All I have to do is put myself in
                my character’s shoes. I never know what will happen next, and
                it’s exhilarating.” Traveling around the globe with scientists
                for parents provided a unique upbringing and perspective on life
                and the world. Spending so much time in exotic, unfamiliar
                locations helped the enigmatic writer form many creative ideas,
                characters, and stories. Family and friends were unwavering
                sources of encouragement for Storie to share this talent with
                the world. A few years ago, when the unknown mystery writer
                decided to “officially” put words on paper, the result was the
                mesmerizing debut, The Summer Heist, followed by the widely
                praised sophomore release of Whispers of a Town Called Luna. And
                now, the highly anticipated Losing Hanley Manor is available at
                bookstores everywhere.
